Core Focus Areas for Java Developers (2025+)

 1. Cloud & DevOps
    Cloud is no longer optional — it's essential.
    ✅ Learn:
       AWS (most used), or Azure/GCP
       IAM, S3, EC2, Lambda, RDS, DynamoDB, SQS/SNS
       Docker & Kubernetes
       CI/CD tools: GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI
       Terraform (Infrastructure as Code)
     Goal: Be able to design, deploy, and troubleshoot cloud-native Java applications.

 2. Spring Ecosystem Mastery
    You're already using Spring — deepen that.
    Spring Boot Advanced
    Spring Cloud (Config Server, Eureka, Gateway, Circuit Breaker)
    Spring Security (OAuth2, JWT)
    Spring Batch (if working with large data or ETL)

 3. Distributed Systems & Microservices
    Modern systems are distributed and event-driven.
    ✅ Learn:
    Microservices patterns: Circuit breaker, API gateway, CQRS, Saga
    Event-driven architecture (Kafka, RabbitMQ)
    gRPC and REST vs GraphQL
    Designing for observability: metrics, tracing, logging

 4. Data Engineering & Analytics
    Companies need Java devs who understand data.

    ✅ Learn:
    Big Data basics: Hadoop, Spark (at least conceptually)
    Apache Kafka deeply
    SQL & NoSQL (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra)
    ETL pipelines and stream processing

 5. AI + ML for Developers

    ✅ Learn:
    Prompt engineering (ChatGPT, LLMs)
    LangChain / LlamaIndex
    Integrate AI into Java apps (e.g., OpenAI APIs)
    Understand ML pipelines (data preprocessing, model serving)

   Bonus: Basic Python, ML libraries like Scikit-learn, Pandas

 6. Software Architecture & System Design
    For becoming a tech lead, architect, or principal engineer.
    ✅ Learn:
       High-level architecture (monolith vs microservices vs serverless)
       System design (scalability, consistency, CAP theorem)
       Caching (Redis, CDN), load balancing, rate limiting
       Design for high availability and fault tolerance

     Resource: Grokking System Design, Gaurav Sen YouTube

 7. Leadership & Soft Skills (optional but valuable)
    ✅ Improve:
      Communication, mentoring
      Agile/Scrum process
      Project estimation
      Writing technical documents & design proposals

 Tools & Platforms You Should Be Comfortable With
 Tool	                   Why Learn It
 Git & GitHub              Collaboration & CI/CD
 Postman                   API testing
 IntelliJ                  IDE mastery
 VS Code                   For cloud & scripting work
 Elasticsearch + Kibana    Logging & observability

 ✅ 3. CodiumAI for Java
     What: VS Code & JetBrains plugin that uses AI to write smart unit tests.
     Generates JUnit tests, even edge cases.
     Website: codium.ai

 ✅ 4. OpenAI / GPT-based Tools (Custom)
   What: Many developers now use ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, Tabnine to:
   Generate JUnit tests from Java methods.
   Suggest boundary tests or mocks.
   Not a single tool, but part of your IDE assistant.

 Many companies do not expose OpenAI API directly from the UI, because:
 You’d have to leak your API key to the browser (even with environment variables at build time, it still gets embedded in JS bundle).
 User -> Frontend -> Backend (Spring Boot / Node) -> OpenAI API -> MCP -> Microservices

12 MCP Servers You Can Use in 2025

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open standard that simplifies how AI models, particularly LLMs,
interact with external data sources, tools, and services.
An MCP server acts as a bridge between these AI models and external tools. Here are the top MCP servers:

1 - File System MCP Server
    Allows the LLM to directly access the local file system to read, write, and create directories.

2 - GitHub MCP Server
    Connects Claude to GitHub repos and allows file updates, code searching.

3 - Slack MCP Server
    MCP Server for Slack API, enabling Claude to interact with Slack workspaces.

4 - Google Maps MCP Server
    MCP Server for Google Maps API.

5 - Docker MCP Server
    Integrate with Docker to manage containers, images, volumes, and networks.

6 - Brave MCP Server
    Web and local search using Brave’s Search API.

7 - PostgreSQL MCP Server
    An MCP server that enables LLM to inspect database schemas and execute read-only queries.

8 - Google Drive MCP Server
    An MCP server that integrates with Google Drive to allow reading and searching over files.

9 - Redis MCP Server
    MCP Server that provides access to Redis databases.

10 - Notion MCP Server
     This project implements an MCP server for the Notion API.

11 - Stripe MCP Server
     MCP Server to interact with the Stripe API.

12 - Perplexity MCP Server
    An MCP Server that connects to Perplexity’s Sonar API for real-time search.
